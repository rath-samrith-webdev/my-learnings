// **Borrowing and References
// Sometimes you want to use a value without taking ownership of it.
// Rust lets you do this using a reference - this is called borrowing:
// **What is a Reference?
// A reference lets you look at a value without owning it. You create a reference using the & symbol:

// **Why Borrowing is Important
// Borrowing helps you reuse values safely, without giving them away.

// 1.It lets you use values without taking ownership
// 2.It avoids cloning, which can be slow for large data
// 3.It makes your programs safer and faster

//Example: Referencing

let a = String:from("10");
let b = &a;

println!("a = {}", a);
println!("b = {}", b);


// Mutable References
// If you want to change a value through a reference, you need to make the reference mut:

let mut name = String::from("John");
let name_ref = &mut name;
name_ref.push_str(" Doe");

println!("{}", name_ref); // John Doe

// Note: You can only have one mutable reference to a value at a time!
